Hi,


Thanks for your response to @StartEmpathy on Twitter the other day! My name is Erika and I am managing the social media for Start Empathy, an initiative of Ashoka<http://www.ashoka.org>.


Start Empathy's goal is to bring empathy, emotional intelligence, and social-emotional learning to the forefront of education conversations; we work with a network of schools who show outstanding devotion to SEL practices, and publish articles and toolkits for a community of educators that follow us on our various networks. If you would like to see more, you can visit our website<http://www.startempathy.org>.


We would love to distribute the work you're doing with kids, coding, and empathy & tech to our networks. Would you be interested in contributing to the StartEmpathy blog, or in cross-posting materials? Your kid-friendly approach to coding is a great example of not only child agency in learning, but also of empathizing with new technologies and learning mediums.


If you're interested, we can set up a call for sometime next week to discuss logistics. I'm looking forward to speaking with you, and hope you have a nice Friday!


Sincerely,

Erika Bullock

Hi,


Thanks for your response to @StartEmpathy on Twitter the other day! My name is Erika and I am managing the social media for Start Empathy, an initiative of Ashoka<http://www.ashoka.org>.


Start Empathy's goal is to bring empathy, emotional intelligence, and social-emotional learning to the forefront of education conversations; we work with a network of schools who show outstanding devotion to SEL practices, and publish articles and toolkits for a community of educators that follow us on our various networks. If you would like to see more, you can visit our website<http://www.startempathy.org>.


We would love to distribute the work you're doing with kids, coding, and empathy & tech to our networks. Would you be interested in contributing to the StartEmpathy blog, or in cross-posting materials? Your kid-friendly approach to coding is a great example of not only child agency in learning, but also of empathizing with new technologies and learning mediums.


If you're interested, we can set up a call for sometime next week to discuss logistics. I'm looking forward to speaking with you, and hope you have a nice Friday!


Sincerely,

Erika Bullock

I'm Brent from analyticsMD <https://analyticsmd.com/>, a Mountain View
based company that helps hospitals manage patient flow, staffing and other
operational issues using predictive modeling.  We are getting ready to
deploy in the ED at San Mateo, and Mike Aratow has been our main champion
through the process.

I wanted to reach out and introduce myself and Mudit (CC’d) and see if we
could find some time to more properly introduce both the software and
ourselves.  It would also be great to get to know you a little bit and get
your feedback on which use cases we’ve put together might be most helpful
for you and your fellow physicians.

Alex, CC’d, can help us find an hour sometime in the next week or so (this
week if possible), if that works with you.  Since we're down here in
Mountain View, we can easily drive up and meet you in person.

Look forward to talking soon!

       Thanks, Gaurav.       
          My colleague Anne, copied here, can help find time for you to meet with Aubrey Kendall and Jack Chou at Pinterest.          
          Otherwise, do you have 20 minutes to connect via video conference (with me) tomorrow anytime after 3pm PT?          
          Let me know.          
          Thanks!

Nice to e-meet you! I'm glad you and Margaret were able to schedule a time
for Margaret and Guarav to connect tomorrow. If it is alright with you, I
will send Gia (recruiter at Pinterest) your email so she can reach out to
you directly to schedule time for Gaurav with Aubrey and Jack.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks so much!

Hi Melissa,

10:30 works better for Mark on Wednesday. I have updated the invitation. Please let me know if that does not work for you and we can look at some other times.

Sure, we'd love to chat with you.

My name is Mark and I'm the founder of Helpful Human. I've copied our assistant to find a time that works for both of us. Please Alex know, after she reaches out to you, if you'd like an in-person or over the phone consultation to start.

We're just up the road from you in the Smith Tower.

Hi Bob,

Hope you are doing well. I am quite excited for our meeting next week. I was wondering if we could do a 10 minute call this week or early next week to make sure I am focusing on the right pieces for our meeting on Thursday?

Alex can coordinate with Debbie if you think that makes sense
