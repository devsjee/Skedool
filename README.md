During my internship with Skedool Inc., I implemented a Named Entity Recognition module of the smart scheduling assistant ’Alex’ using Machine
Learning and Regular Expressions. Achieved 12% and 17% increase in the precision and recall scores of the Stanford NER tagger respectively by
adding custom rules.
